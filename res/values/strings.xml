    <string name="welcome">To use, in any application, select some text (press and hold), then select <i>Share</i> and choose
        <b>Smart Share to Calendar</b>
        to automatically create a calendar event.<br/>
        Depending on your calendar application, a screen will be shown asking you to confirm the event to be added -
        and allowing you to change some event specific options.
        With many applications selecting text is not required, e.g K9 mail, you can just share the entire email and
        <b>Smart Share to Calendar</b> will figure out the important details.<br/>
